Daniel Shiffman, NYU ITP. Did this first in JavaScript. My project is using the JSON data he collected by crowdsourcing. Thanks Daniel!

I highly recommend watching some of his [videos](https://www.youtube.com/TheCodingTrain), they are fantastic for learning. I also strongly advise reading his book, The Nature of Code.
